# FinalProject
## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model combining Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based architectures for early cancer detection. The model aims to accurately classify histopathological images from the Breast Cancer Histopathological Database (BreakHis), leveraging multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms to improve detection accuracy and robustness.

## Dataset
The project uses the BreakHis dataset, which contains over 7,000 breast cancer histopathological images divided into benign and malignant categories, across four magnification levels (40x, 100x, 200x, and 400x). Data preprocessing includes resizing, normalization, and data augmentation techniques.
